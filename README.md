This example demonstrates a common pitfall in F#: using mutable variables within functions and unexpected side effects.  The `add` function doesn't explicitly take mutable variables as inputs.  The example intends to add `x` and `y`, but the behavior is unexpected due to the function's interaction with the global mutable variables.  The solution showcases a functional approach to solving the problem.
